# Predicting crash-like days
For this data analysis, I developed two procedures known as the Volatility approach and the Duration approach to implement machine learning classification algorithms for predicting crash-like days in the Bakken crude oil timeseries data set.
The codes for the two approaches are provided here that also consists of Exploratory Data Analysis including line plots and heatmaps to investigate any trend or missing data in the data set.
